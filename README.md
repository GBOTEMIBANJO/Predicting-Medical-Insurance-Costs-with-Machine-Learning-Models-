# Predicting-Medical-Insurance-Costs-with-Machine-Learning-Models-

Overview
This project analyzes healthcare cost drivers and builds predictive models to estimate medical charges using demographic/clinical features. Key components include:

Regression modeling (Linear/Ridge/Lasso)

Sensitivity analysis for model robustness evaluation

Comprehensive EDA with actionable insights

Feature engineering for categorical variables

Motivation: Healthcare costs burden 41% of Americans with medical debt (KFF, 2022). This work helps identify key cost drivers to inform policy and personal financial planning.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
insurance.csv (1,338 records) contains:

Feature	Description	Type
age	Patient age (18-64)	Numerical
sex	Biological sex	Categorical
bmi	Body Mass Index	Numerical
children	Dependents count	Numerical
smoker	Tobacco usage	Categorical
region	US geographic region	Categorical
charges	Medical costs (USD)	Target Variable
ðŸ›  Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Missing value analysis (No missing data found)

Categorical encoding:

One-Hot: sex, smoker, region

Feature scaling: StandardScaler for numerical features

2. Exploratory Analysis
python
Copy
# Example: Charge distribution by smoking status
sns.boxplot(x='smoker', y='charges', data=df)
Charge Distribution
Key Insight: Smokers incur 3.8X higher costs than non-smokers (p<0.001)

3. Model Development
python
Copy
models = {
    'Linear Regression': LinearRegression(),
    'Ridge (Î±=0.5)': Ridge(alpha=0.5),
    'Lasso (Î±=0.2)': Lasso(alpha=0.2)
}
4. Sensitivity Analysis Framework
python
Copy
# Test 100 random train-test splits
scores = []
for _ in range(100):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    scores.append(model.score(X_test, y_test))

Results
Model Comparison
Model	RÂ² (Mean)	MSE (Std Dev)
Linear Regression	0.78	0.23
Ridge Regression	0.77	0.24
Lasso Regression	0.76	0.25
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity Plot
Linear regression shows highest variance (Î”RÂ²=0.12) across splits


Key Findings
Top Cost Drivers:

Smoking (+$23,685 vs non-smokers)

Age (+$257/year)

BMI (+$393/unit BMI >30)

Model Insights:

Simple linear regression outperforms regularized variants

Region has minimal predictive power (Î²=0.03)

 
 Conclusion
While linear regression provides a reasonable baseline (RÂ²=0.78), sensitivity analysis reveals significant performance fluctuations across data splits.

Recommended improvements:

Incorporate clinical features (e.g., chronic conditions)

Test non-linear models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)

Address potential omitted variable bias
